Unlocking your account  (use non-WiFi phone #)

To unlock your account, you must enter a security code you receive via text message from Microsoft.
The mobile phone number you use to receive this text message doesn't need to be associated with your account.
It doesn't even need to be your own phone number.
If your mobile phone doesn't receive text messages, ask a friend or family member if you can use theirs.

Follow these steps to unlock your account:

    Go to https://account.microsoft.com and sign in to your locked account.

    Enter a mobile phone number to request a security code be sent to you via text message.
    This can be any mobile phone that can receive text messages.

    After the text arrives, enter the security code into the web page.

    Change your password to complete the unlocking process.
    Use the tips in Help protect your Microsoft account to create a strong password.
