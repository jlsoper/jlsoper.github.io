"It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;<br>
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
And though we are not now that strength which in old days<br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are<br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will;<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."
